Welcome back, everyone! This is the second part of our series on Magnetism. I hope you checked out our first article, aptly named Part 1, where I published the [Magnetized Condition](https://criticalgamemastery.com/posts/july-homebrew-magnetism-part-1/). 

The spells I will be showing you today are built upon this Magnetized Condition. We had a blast preparing and testing these spells out and I hope you do as well. 

For now, the spells go from 0 to 5th and there is a total of 10. In the future, I will be adding in 6th to 9th level spells. The goal is to have 2-3 spells per level and 1 each for 8th and 9th. The tricky part is, a lot of the things that would normally be done at those higher levels are already done with spells from the Player's Handbook. By this, I'm talking about [Earthquake](https://www.dnd-spells.com/spell/earthquake), [Reverse Gravity](https://www.dnd-spells.com/spell/reverse-gravity), and [Meteor Swarm](https://www.dnd-spells.com/spell/meteor-swarm). 

Here is a link to the [Magnetized Condition](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/SJSe3lfSMB) as well, in case you didn't check it out or you lost it. 

Here are a couple reminders about the Magnetized Condition to get you primed: 
- When a creature becomes Magnetized, it gains a number of polarity levels specified by the effect. These polarity levels are either positive or negative. 
- You add together levels of the same polarity and subtract levels of the opposite: if you have 2 positive levels and gain 1 negative, you now have 1 positive level. 
- Some effect's have limitations on how many levels can be gained
- When Magnetized, a creature or object emits a magnetic field in a 5 x polarity level diameter sphere. This field attracts opposite polarities and repels same polarities. (*This is an optional rule that I personally like to use, but if you don't want the DM overhead, then don't use it*)

### Polarity Levels
| LEVEL | EFFECT |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1 | Disadvantage on ability checks.  |
| 2 | Attacks against the creature made with metal weapons have advantage and the creatureâ€™s attack rolls with metal weapons have disadvantage. |
| 3 | Speed halved |
| 4 | Restrained |
| 5 | Stunned |
| 6 | Unconscious |
| 7 | Death |

These spells are finished, as they have been thoroughly play tested on our end, but I am obviously happy to edit and revise them according to your suggestions and input. Here we go!

## Spell Descriptions

#### Crushing Electro-Sphere
*5th-level evocation [magnetic]*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a massive sphere of electro-magnetic energy 10 feet in diameter with walls 1 inch thick. The walls are impervious to nonmagical metal weapons and projectiles and it reflects all lightning damage back towards the source, or up to the limit of the effect's range, whichever comes first. Creatures inside the sphere have total cover from all nonmagical metal weapon attacks and half cover from spells and magical weapon attacks.

While concentrating on this spell, you can perform a variety of actions; creatures that are Magnetized with at least 1 polarity leve have disadvantage on their saving throws against this spell:
- **Move**: As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see within range or cause the sphere to "release" it's contents at it's current location.
- **Envelope**: As an action, if the sphere is empty, you command the sphere to move up to 60 feet to a space you can see within range and envelope all creatures you choose in a 10x10 space, causing them to be trapped floating inside it. Creatures can avoid being enveloped with a successful Dexterity saving throw. While enveloped, wherever the sphere moves, the creatures move also. A creature can attempt to break free of the sphere with a successful Strength saving throw as an action.
- **Crush**: As an action, you crush the contents of the sphere. Creatures must succeed a Strength saving throw or take 4d8 bludgeoning damage, or half as much if successful, and be restrained (escape DC equals your spell save DC) until you use an action to command the sphere to do something else. 
- **Polarize**: As a bonus action, you choose either positive or negative polarity and cause the outside of the sphere to become Magnetized, as per the Magnetized condition, with up to 5 levels of the chosen polarity. The sphere does not move toward or away from any magnetic sources, but does project a magnetic field and pull or repel other creatures and objects according to it's polarity level. The sphere stays Magnetized in this way until the beginning of your next turn.

When you cast this spell, you may also use the Envelope option as a bonus action before the end of your turn.

#### EMD (Electro-Magnetic Defenestration) Sphere
*4th-level evocation [magnetic]*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A sphere of shifting electro-magnetic energy 2 feet in diamter appears between your hands. When you cast this spell, and as an action on subsequent turns while the spell is active, you command the sphere to strike a creature you can see within range. Any creature struck by the sphere must succeed on a Dexterity save or take 2d8 Lightning damage, or half as much on a successful one.

Additionally, any creature Large or smaller that fails it's Dexterity save is picked up and launched 30 feet straight up into the air, taking falling damage as applicable. If an obstacle prevents the creature from reaching the full height, it takes 1d6 Bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet of movement it was unable to complete. Creatures that are Magnetized with at least 1 level of any polarity have disadvantage on their saving throws versus this spell.

#### Electro-Magnetic Orb
*1st-level evocation [magnetic]*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create an orb of concentrated electro-magnetic energy in your hand and throw it at a target. Choose either a postiive or negative polarity and make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see. You have advantage on the attack if the target is Magnetized, with a different polarity and disadvantage if the target has the same polarity. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 Lightning damage and becomes Magnetized with 1 level of the polarity you chose. Starting on your next turn, you may use your bonus action to deal an additional 1d10 Lightning damage and increase the target's polarity level by 1. You may not increase the target's polarity level past 3 using this spell.

At the end of the creature's turn, it may make a Constitution save to lower it's polarity level by 1, to a minimum of 0. The spell ends if you use your bonus action to do anything else or if the target is outside the spell's range or if it has total cover from you at the end of your turn.

**At Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the intial and recurring damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st. 

#### Harness Electro-Magnetism
*3rd-level transmutation [magnetic]*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You draw upon the electro-magnetic energy in nature and bind it to your body, causing you to emit sparks of harmless static for the duration of the spell. While this spell is active, you can unleash arcs of this energy upon your foes. 

When you cast this spell, choose a point you can see within range. You launch an arcing bolt of magnetized lightning, of a polarity you choose, from your hand to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 Lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If  a creature fails it's saving throw and takes lightning damage from this spell, they become Magnetized with 2 levels of the polarity you chose. On each of your turns utnil the spell ends, you can use your action to launch lightning, also choosing the polarity, in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one. 

Creatures who are Magnetized this way remian so for 1 minute, with the duration resetting if the creature takes lightning damage before the effect expires. A creature who is magnetized by this spell may attempt a Constitution save at the end of their turn to reduce their polarity level by 1, to a minimum of 0. 

A creature may not have thier polarity level increased past 4 with this spell.

If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, you draw power from the storm itself. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d8.

**At Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. 

#### Ionic Bonding
*3rd-level transmutation [magnetic]*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a horseshoe magnet)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause an arc of electro-magnetic energy to spark between two creatures you can see within range that are within 30 feet of each other. These creatures must succeed on a Constitution save or take 5d8 Lightning damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail their save also become Magnetized for 1 minute with 3 levels of a polarity of your choice, or 1 level on a success, choosing separately for each creature. 

A creature that is Magnetized by this spell may attempt a Constitution save at the end of their turn to reduce their polarity level by 1, to a minimum of 0.

**At Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you may target an additional creature for every two slot levels above 3rd. 

#### Impale
*2nd-level transmutation [magnetic]*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a stone spike)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You distort the magnetic field below a creature you can see within range to form a metal and stone spike and drive it violently from the earth to impale them. Make a melee spell attack against the target. If you hit, the creature takes 2d10 piercing damage and is grappled. A creature that ends it's turn grappled by this spell takes an additional 1d10 piercing damage. A grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength saving throw to free themselves, ending the spell.

#### Magnetizing Shock
*evocation cantrip [magnetic]*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A creature you can see within range must succeed on a Dexterity save or take 1d6 Lightning damage and become Magnetized with 1 polarity level of your choice until the end of your next turn. You cannot raise a creature or object's polarity level above 1 with this spell.

Alternatively, you may target an unattended object within range that weighs at least 10 lbs. It automatically fails its save.

This spell's damage increases by 1d6 lightning damage when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

#### Magnetic Surge
*1st-level evocation [magnetic]*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause a spherical burst of magnetic energy, either positive or negative, to instantly attract or repel all metal objects within a 10-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. All creatures within this burst must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have any metal objects or weapons they are holding be ripped from their hands and suffer an effect based off the polarity of the spell. Unattended, inanimate metal objects that weigh 5 lbs or less are automatically affected.

**Positive Polarity**: All affected objects are pulled to the center of the sphere and become magnetically charged for 1 minute with 1 positive polarity level. In order to free any of the objects, a creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, at which point the object ceases to be Magnetitzed by this spell.

If a creature is in the center of the sphere when the spell is cast, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. All the affected metal objects stick to the creature with a strong magnetic force. 

**Negative Polarity**: Objects are launched 30 feet away from the creature holding it in the most direct path away from the center of the sphere.

#### Static Charge
*2nd-level evocation [magnetic]*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of felt)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You charge your body with electro-magnetic energy of a polarity of your choice that increases in power as you move. As a bonus action, before the end of your turn, you can release this energy in a 10-foot-radius burst around you. All creatures within this burst must make a Dexterity save. A creature takes 1d6 Lightning damage plus an additional 1d6 for every 10 feet you have moved since you cast this spell, up to a maximum of 4d6 on a failed save or half as much on a success. Creatures that fail the save and take Lightning damage also become Magnetized with 1 polarity level of the polarity of your choice for 1 minute. 

**At Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial damage and maximum damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Wall of Magnetic Iron
*5th-level conjuration [magnetic]*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a block of mangetized iron)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You cause a flat, magnetized, vertical iron wall to spring into being that is 6 inches thick and 40 feet long and 10 feet high. The wall inserts itseelf into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so taht it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice).

Choose a side of the wall to have a positive polarity and a side to have a negative polarity. One of these polarities has a level of 3 and the other has a level of 1. 

If you desire, the wall can be created vertically, resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction, rather than letting it fall randomly, by succeeding on a DC 25 Strength check. Creatures with room to flee may attempt to do so by succeeding on a Dexterity save. Any creature that is smaller than Large that fails the save takes 10d6 points of Bludgeoning damage and is restrained, or half as much damage and not restrained on a success. A creature that ends it's turn restrained by the wall takes 3d6 Bludgeoning damage.

The wall is an object made of iron that can be damaged and thus breached. The wall has AC 15 and 30 Hit Points per inch of thickness. reducing a 5 foot portion of the wall to 0 Hit Points destroys it, creating a 5 foot breach.
