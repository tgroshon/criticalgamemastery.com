  Welcome to Critical Game Mastery! This is a project many years in the making that has been delayed for a myriad of reasons, some of them were semi-reasonable ones. Our goal here is to present the combined years of practice and experience at being Game Masters and players for tabletop role playing games, including the world's greatest: Dungeons & Dragons.
  
  Much of our content will be released via a monthly article written by one of our staff. We will also be presenting a fully play tested D&D Homebrew, created by us, free for you to use in your own game. We invite constructive criticism from you, yes you, to improve what we present to you so we can always be providing something great and useful in your own games. You are an integral part of making this work and we appreciate your feedback.
  
  Our content is meant to be free and open to all who want to use it, without restriction or barriers. We have a [Patreon] (https://www.patreon.com/CriticalGameMastery) set up for those of you who wish to financially support our work in small ways. Any money pledged to us is used to help keep the site open and increase the frequency and quality of our articles and Homebrew. In return for your support, we will be providing additional behind-the-scenes insights into how we come up with, choose, test, and implement the very concepts we are sharing with the world as well as exclusive access to Patreon-only privileges and channels within our Discord. Pledging to our Patreon is certainly no requirement and is not a obligation.
  
  It is our hope that we can help inspire Dungeon Masters and players to create games and develop skills that surpass our own. If you like what you see here, please join us on [Discord] (https://discord.gg/M3rEEGX) and follow us on Twitter so we can create a community of gamers to uplift one another.
  
   Welcome to Critical Game Mastery.
