# Druid Circle of Pyromancy
*Nature is not always flowers, rainbows and sunshine. It isn’t always the soothing breeze through your hair and gentle rains nourishing the crops of humanity. It is also fire. It is destruction. It is the lava spewing from the ash plumed volcanos. Druids of the Pyromancy Circle draw their power from these sources of nature and more.*

*Long ago in ancient pyromancer lore, a powerful witch goddess and her followed thought they could create a new Sun to keep the world from descending into darkness. They failed miserably. From their failures were created the Chaos Flame from which Demons are born to reduce the green world to ashes. This history may not be correct and there are many holes to it. The pyromancers believe it nonetheless.*

##### Circle of Pyromancy Quirks
| 1d6 | Pyromancer Quirk |
|:----:|:-------------|
| **1** | Your eyes smolder with flame and your tears are streams of mild acid. |
| **2** | While casting spells, the ground around you smolders and plants burn as if touched with hot coals. |
| **3** | A haze of smoke, ash, and floating embers swirls slightly around you at all times. |
| **4** | Flames grow hotter and brighter the closer you get to them. |
| **5** | Your core beliefs demand that you burn a moderate amount of vegetation daily. |
| **6** | Fiends have an unnatural respect and willingness to listen to you. |

### Circle Spells
The following spells are added to your spell list and are always considered prepared.

| Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|
| **2nd** | *burning hands, hellish rebuke* |
| **3rd** | *scorching ray, melf’s acid arrow* |
| **5th** | *fireball, melf’s minute meteors* |
| **7th** | *fire shield (warm only), wall of fire* |
| **9th** | *cloudkill, immolation* |

### Chaos Magic
Starting at 2nd level, you can manifest the Chaos Flame in an open hand for a number of minutes equal to your Druid level as an item manipulation action. This flame acts as a druidic focus for your Circle spells and any other Druid spells you know that deal fire damage. While this flame is active, you know and may cast the *spellwarp: chaos* cantrip.

As an action while your Chaos Flame is active, you can expend one of your wildshape uses to channel chaotic pyromancy for 1 minute. During this time, the damage dice of any spell you cast from a Druid spell slot that deals fire damage increases by one die size, up to a maximum of d12s

You can dismiss your Chaos Flame on your turn without using an action. 

> #### Damage Die Increases
> d4 > d6 > d8 > d10 > d12

### Power Within
Beginning at 6th level, while your Chaos Flame is active, you know and may cast the *spellwarp: molten* cantrip.

Once per turn, when you deal damage with a molten or chaos spell, you can choose to deal an extra die of damage. You take damage equal to the result that cannot be reduced or ignored and your maximum hit points are lowered by the same amount until you finish a long rest.

### Flash Sweat
At 10th level, you gain resistance to acid, fire and poison damage as well as immunity to the poisoned condition. You also take no damage from acid or fire spells you cast.

### Corrupting Chaos
Starting at 14th level, whenever you summon your Chaos Flame, you can expend an additional use of wild shape to transform yourself into a fiend with a CR no higher than your Druid level divided by 4 (rounded down).

> ### New Cantrip: Spellwarp
> *Transmutation*
> 
> - **Casting Time**: 1 Action
> - **Range**: Self
> - **Components**: V, S
> - **Duration**: Instantaneous
> 
> When you learn this cantrip you may choose a Spell Variant. When you cast this spell, you may immediately cast another spell this turn with a casting time of 1 action as a bonus action and warp the spell’s energy by adding the Spell Variant effect to it, if it is a valid spell. The affected spell gains the appropriate Spell Variant trait.
>
> Valid spells have to having a matching damage type or school and either rely upon a spell attack roll or saving throw.

## Spell Variants
The following descriptors can be added to existing spells to create new versions and add new effects. Only one variation can be applied to a spell at a time. Many spell warping traits split the modified damage of the spell into two sets of damage dice. The caster chooses which damage type to round the dice to.

#### Chaos
- **Valid Spells**: Spells that deal fire or acid damage.
- **Damage Dice**: Half fire and half acid. 
- **Effect**: A creature that fails its saving throw or is hit by a spell attack by a Chaos spell is set ablaze for a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting modifier. Creatures set ablaze take fire damage equal to your spellcasting modifier on subsequent rounds at the end of their turn unless they succeed on a Dexterity save to end the effect.

#### Molten
- **Valid Spells**: Spells that deal fire damage.
- **Damage Dice**: Half fire and half bludgeoning.
- **Effect**: Spells with the Molten trait leave a heap of lava in each 5 foot space affected by the spell that persists for a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting modifier. If the spell has an attack roll, choose a 5 foot space each hit creature occupies. Creatures who enter or end their turn in those spaces take fire damage equal to your spellcasting modifier.
