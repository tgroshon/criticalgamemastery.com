# Sorcererous Origin: Jade Phoenix Mage
*"Long ago, a fellowship of swordsages known as the Masters of the Jade Phoenix took up the study of arcane magic in search of a new martial discipline. They discovered that the mental austerity and economy of action each swordsage had cultivated in his martial studies opened the door to a powerful and unique form of arcane mastery. Properly applied, the stances and maneuvers of a martial discipline provided the mage with exceptional power and control in his arcane spellcasting - and by channeling the arcane energy of his spells into his martial maneuvers, be achieved supernatural perfection in his chosen disciplines.*

*For years, this secret society defended the land against evil, perfecting this new path that wove together martial disciplines and arcane power. Then a terrible abomination, known only as the Souldrake, descended on the world, wreaking unthinkable destruction across the land. The realm defended by the masters of the Jade Phoenix was swept into ruin, but the arcane swordsages gathered together and confronted this fearsome enemy. Many masters died, but at the end of the struggle, the awful Souldrake was bound and imprisoned in a hidden vault. To ensure that their foe would never break free, the thirteen surviving members of the Jade Phoenix fellowship swore a mighty oath to walk the world for all eternity, maintaining the Souldrake's prison with their own unceasing vigilance. Such was the power of their oath that these spirits have been reborn again and again in the world, keeping the Souldrake immured in its secret prison.*

*Today, thirteen Jade Phoenix mages walk the earth - no more, no less. The instant one dies, a new one is born somewhere in the world. As he grows and learns, he is inevitably drawn to both the Sublime Way and the magical arts - for he was a master swordsage and a mighty wizard in previous lives he has now forgotten. In time, another Jade Phoenix master discovers the new incarnation of his old companion. In an age-old rite, the existing master awakens his newfound comrade to awareness of his past lives, renews the oaths of vigilance that bind the Souldrake in its prison, and reveals to him the secrets of the order. Both Jade Phoenix brothers then go their own way, their ancient duty discharged until once again a Jade Phoenix Mage dies and is reborn."*

### Quirks
1. A mysterious tattoo appears somewhere on your body of the Jade Phoenix.
2. Sorcerer spells you cast emit green flames and leave trails of ash.
3. You have trouble separating the memories of your current self from your past selves.
4. When you bleed, your blood turns to ash as it falls to the ground.
5. Your skin feels hot to the touch as if you were suffering from a severe fever.
6. Your eyes glow an otherworldly emerald green color.


### Martial Study
Beginning at 1st level, you gain 1 hit point. At every level beyond 1st, you gain 1 additional hit point. You also gain proficiency in light armor, simple weapons, and one one-handed martial weapon of your choice.

### Arcane Wrath
At 6th level, once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee spell or weapon attack you can expend a sorcerer spell slot to deal an extra 1d8 force damage to the target, plus another 1d8 per level of the spell slot.

### Mystic Stance
At 14th level, as a bonus action you enter one of the following stances, gaining it’s benefits for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell):
- **Mystic Phoenix Stance**: You reduce the sorcery point cost for any Metamagics you know by 1, to a minimum of 0.
- **Firebird Stance**: You gain resistance to fire damage and once per turn, when you hit with a spell or weapon attack, you can deal extra fire damage equal to your charisma modifier.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Emerald Immolation
At 18th level, you can immolate yourself with the cosmic, consumptive power of the Jade Phoenix. As an action, you explode in a searing blast of green fire in a 20-foot radius. All creatures in the blast must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 10d6 fire damage and 10d6 force damage, or half as much on a successful one. 

Creatures native to different plane of existence must immediately succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished to their home plane. This blast utterly destroys you, but 1d6 rounds later, you re-form in the exact spot where you were when you employed this ability. You are incapacitated for 1 round after you reappear, but you are healed of all damage and all conditions are removed. Any equipment you were wearing or objects you were holding or carrying when you used this ability re-form with you, exactly as they were.
Once you have used this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

> #### Design Notes
> The JPM was always a favorite class of mine from the 3.5 era. It was like the Immortal Iron Fist with spellcasting. For the best effect, I’d recommend the player choose the Soul Blade CGM Cantrip.
>
> **Martial Study**: Similar to the Draconic Bloodline with the HP boost. The armor and weapon proficiency helps a ton to solidify the combat orientation of this subclass. This also alleviates the need for Mage Armor taking up a Known Spell.
>
> **Arcane Wrath**: In the original class, this feature was gained first to give the character a power spike in melee combat. I wanted to extend that further without overloading the kit. I could move AW to 1st and remove the additional spell list to make it more melee combat focused. Without having Extra Attack, AW is a one attempt feature, unlike the Paladin. The tradeoff is the damage type being Force and the damage scaling much higher than the Paladin. I debated on whether I should implement an effect or the AW, but am leaning towards the ‘no’ side of things.
>
> **Mystic Stances**: These are strong, but limited in use. The big one being, reducing MM costs. I’m thinking of changing these to provide smaller, permanent bonuses that don’t have the limited usage.
>
> **Emerald Immolation**: The capstone of the JPM. I basically ripped this directly from the original class and simply updated it for the new edition. I kept the damage the same and change the types to fire and force. This is where the Phoenix part of the class becomes evident, in a nuclear explosion that resurrects you from the ashes.
>
> **Multiclassing**: It’s not a bad idea for the JPM to multiclassing into Warlock for Hexblade, giving access to Pact of the Blade and other invocations.
