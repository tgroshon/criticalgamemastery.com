Welcome back to the second part of our World Building mini-series! This article assumes you read [July 2019’s article on World Building: Setting the Stage]((https://criticalgamemastery.com/posts/july-article-world-building-part-1/), however, you will still be able to follow along with this article even if you haven’t read it because these aren’t necessarily meant to be an exact Step-by-Step process for everyone. It is *my* / *our* process, but that does not mean it has to be yours. These steps can be taken in any order.

## How *Does* the World Work?

When Dirk or I go to build a world from the ground up, we do prefer to set up the themes of the world and establish a location and setting to portray those things, but those don’t really do justice to the freshly born world. The next thing we try to figure out is: how does the world work? There are some deeper questions that branch off of this singular question, namely: what sets this world apart from others?

The main key points that are filled in for the new world are the following:

+ **Politics**
+ **Religion**
+ **Magic**
+ **Technology**
+ **Planes of Existence**

These points are in no particular order, because they normally work hand-in-hand in establishing the history of the world as well as helping the players feel like the world is new and different from anything else they have experienced, even though you are probably going to steal mercilessly from writers infinitely more successful than you or I.

I am going to use some examples from current and historical events (namely politics and religion), as well as pop culture, to illustrate some of the points I wish to make. I don’t want you to feel like I am preaching or pushing my beliefs or anyone else’s on you.

### Politics

I know, I know, I know... don’t talk politics, ESPECIALLY on the internet. I’m going to do it anyways. Politics and the way the governments of your world work are extremely important to helping define the unique reality you are trying to create and demonstrate to your players. They determine the ebb and flow of power and culture, as well as the drama and limitations of the present and future.

Little bit of a history lesson here, coming from someone who is definitely not a historian, professor, or academic, so please correct me if I’m wrong. There is an enormous amount of structures of government that would be useful for building your world. I am going to lay a few out here with a very mild description. If you are interested further in specific forms of government institutions and political processes, I do recommend you use this list as a launching point for your research. I am going to list ‘The Big 3.’

+ **Autocracy**: A system of government in which all power rests in a singular individual like a king or queen. They often have vassals that help rule over smaller portions of land, that are delegated power and responsibility to handle certain tasks. This ruling position is typically passed down from generation to generation.
+ **Democracy**: The power of a democratic government comes from the people, whether they elect representatives or directly elect their ruling figure by the power of their vote. 
+ **Oligarchy**: Typically, an oligarchy is one in which a ruling caste or class of people makes the decisions for lower classes. This ruling class is created and identified in a few different ways and power is often contained to the influential families that rule the system and make the rules that keep them in power. 

The main questions to be answered when creating the political and power structures of your world are:

+ Who has the power and makes the decisions for the nation or group?
+ How do others (namely the citizens and neighboring nations) feel about this power?
+ What about this power makes others ally with them?
+ What about this power makes others despise them?
+ How does the government keep it's people in line?
+ If there were 3-5 factions within the government with their own ideas on how things *should* be, what are some of their ideals and goals?

In our own world, the United States of America likes to portray itself as a Democracy, in which the power rests with the people to elect their representatives, and it’s greatest opponents: Russia and China, as Oligarchies, in which the power of the nation rests in the hands of a ruling class of people. Political standpoints aside, let’s live in this fantasy world for a second. The USA stands diametrically opposed to their Russian and Chinese counterparts for a couple of reasons, many of which are ideological by nature. Both sides see each other differently, often with hostility, and play these differences out in the world with how they interact with smaller, less powerful nations. 

When building the politics and governments of your world, I recommend leaving alignment out of it. Most countries in the modern world would fall in the Neutral categories of morality placement with very few sitting in the Good or Evil sides of things. The individuals running the government may be evil or good, but that does not mean the government as a whole reflects this.

The last question asked above is about "factions." Every group of individuals is going to break into smaller faction, each subconsciously choosing their own sub leaders, whether formally or informally. I recommend coming up with a couple factions within the government that have their own motives. I like to break things up into three types of factions:

+ **Traditional**: This faction wants to keep the traditions of the current culture and maintain the status quo. To members of this faction, the system may not be perfect the way it is, but it sure beats the alternatives that often feel like interjecting chaos into an ordered environment.
+ **Progressive**: This faction has a similar perspective as a Traditionalist, except they have ideas meant to "move the world forward" into a New Age, rather than maintaining the status quo. To them, things cannot be done the same way they have in the past and they must make things better for the future. Better is relative. Progressives don't change from different sources of Power, like going from an Autocracy to an Oligarchy for example. They just want things done differently.
+ **Divergent**: Members of this faction believe that the current system is broken and either should or can not be fixed. In fact, the whole system needs to be discarded to make way for a new, better system under new management. Not everyone in this faction is a megalomaniac, it could be Democratic Idealists wanting to overthrow the Autocracy or Oligarchy they currently reside in. 

It is incredibly important to keep in mind, that every faction might have anywhere from a grain to a mountain of truth in their belief structure but choose to blame the other factions for the current system's downfalls. Not to mention, each faction exists on a spectrum, with there being multiple sub-factions within each faction that each take on a different perspective. 

### Religion

Staying in the controversial realms of thought, let’s talk religion. Religion has shaped the entire fabric of the world and the progression of mankind since the dawn of time. It has lead directly into creating the basis of morality in entire hemispheres of the world as well as the power structures that rule them. Religion is very commonly the foundation on which laws and government are built. 

Religion very much has a place in the ruleset of Dungeons & Dragons, even if you do not agree with its place in the world and the future thereof. Entire classes are built upon the idea of faith as an empowering force that grants power, whether from a deity, from nature, or from conviction and force of will. 

When Dirk creates a world to be played in, he normally comes up with the power structures and governments that are in it, and then the religions that founded them. Some are atheist, some are monotheistic, some are pagans, he has a habit of interjecting a faction of fanatical cultists worshipping some kind of Cthulhu-Monster in every single one of his worlds. Here are some questions that he normally will ask himself to help shape the religions of his world:

+ What does this religion worship?
+ What is their end goal?
+ What are their followers like?
+ How do others see the religion and it’s followers?
+ Who is opposed to it?

The last question is very similar to one asked in the Politics section. It asks for opposition. It is a fact that opposition creates drama. I will come back to this later.

Religion and politics work hand in hand and function similarly. Many of the same factions will exist within each religion, each operating as their own ecosystem of thought and motives. In our own world, I would like to call out a major religion to use as an example: Christianity. Most Christians adhere to a similar basis of core values, but are split into countless factions of belief, some of which entirely divergent to the point where others of the same religion question whether or not they even belong in the same belief structure as their own. I'd imagine you could take a good look at any major religion and see similar situations 

### Magic

The way that magic works in the world is extremely important in determining the power structures and religions that shape it. This is simply because magic is the catch-all phrase attached to mystical powers that reshape the fabric of reality. This is the divine power granted from the gods, the fury of mother nature, the conviction of pious paladins, the ancestry of dragons, demons, and angels, deals with otherworldly beings, and a lifetime of obsessive studying and practice. 

It would not be out of the question for the ruling class of an Oligarchy ruled nation to be a group of extremely powerful wizards and spellcasters. It’s not that hard to believe that the ruling figure of a democratic nation of warriors to be one that is vehemently opposed or outright hateful of magic to the point of doing everything they can to suppress it. 

Some of the best ways to create more interesting worlds is to figure out how exactly the magic works. Is this the Wheel of Time setting where you are tampering with a literal and metaphorical fabric of reality, or is this the Mistborn series where much of the magic of the world is determined by metal and alloys. Personally, I love the idea of having multiple different sources of magic that interact and overlap with one another.

Here are a couple of recommendations on how to identify and implement magic in your world in an interesting way, yes... presented as questions... sue me.

+ Can powerful beings bestow power upon others? Would there be a way that others could tell if their power was granted from another being?
+ How can mortals change reality? Can they do so naturally, do they need help, or is it something they must be born with?
+ How mundane and accessible is magic? What sorts of magic would be available to the average joe?
+ Is magic seen positively or negatively by those that don’t use magic? Does this differ from area to area or people to people?
+ What sort of superstitions are held by those skeptical of the use of magic? What is the most ridiculous superstition currently given belief?
+ How is magic used by the rich and powerful to further their designs?
+ How does magic influence the politics and religion of a region or the world as a whole?

Magic is an interesting part of a world because it literally is a power available to shape reality. As such, it can and should be made a centerpiece in politics as well as religion. An Oligarchy of Wizards that run a country where most forms of religion are banned is a very compelling and interesting portion of the world that would make it function very differently than our own.

### Technology

Technology is very much a centerpiece in historical drama, or at least the tool used by one nation to dominate another. Technology is very similar to magic, in that it is embedded in the fabric of civilization and, by its nature, creates competition between nations and factions that often turn violent. 

It is very commonly held that the ruleset of Dungeons & Dragons is set in the middle ages with swords, crossbows, and horses. My belief, however, is that technology in a world that contains magic will most likely find ways to combine the two. The level in which this is done is entirely up to you. 

Now, magic and technology do not have to be joined together in harmony. It is entirely possible that magic and technology can be diametrically opposed as different sciences, much like religion and technology frequently come into conflict and opposition to each other. The question that is often asked by those pursuing one or the other is: where is the line where we say "we have gone too far"?

Here are some questions to ask yourself to help you identify what role technology plays in your world, hint: they are very similar to the questions to ask about magic.

+ How accessible or accepted is technology?
+ What kinds of superstitions or oppositions do the great technological inventors face?
+ How does technology impact the world differently than magic?
+ Why would people choose things to be done with technology over being done with magic?
+ Why would magic and technology be combined in your world, and what factions would be interested in seeing it done more often or not at all?
+ In areas where either technology or magic is either hard to access or completely void, what takes it place and to what degree?

Hopefully, these questions should prompt your writing juices to help you come up with some interesting ideas with how technology fits into your world. 

### The Planes of Existence

The final topic to discuss: The Planes of Existence. I wanted to reserve this topic for last because of how involved it can be. All of the other main concepts of world building: politics, religion, magic, and technology all inevitably feed directly into the question: how does the cosmos / planes of existence work?

In D&D, there is a fairly established set of rules on how the Planes work and interact with each other. Personally, I love it and don’t mess with it too much because of how amazingly well done it is. However, whenever there is another campaign setting released by Wizards of the Coast or another company, one of the new concepts brought up is almost always how the planes exist. 

There are some patterns I have noticed in the different worlds and existences created by professional companies that I try to implement in my own work. 

+ A place for souls of the dead to go.
+ A place for good or bad people.
+ A place for neither.
+ A place for chaos.
+ A place for order.
+ A place for the Gods.
+ A place for the weird.
+ A place to connect it all.
+ A place that isn’t.

Yeah, those are a lot of places. Many worlds that I have seen will combine some of these planes into singular ones that are ruled by a deity. D&D has a habit of having a bunch of "weird" places like the Shadowfell and the Feywild. All are acceptable and are useful for creating an interesting world full of mystery.

Alternatively, you can follow the more Christian structure of doing things:

+ **Earth**: Home of Humans, it’s where we are born and die and otherwise get tested by an all powerful God and a dubiously powerful Satan, or  otherwise adversarial entity.
+ **Heaven**: Where the spirits of the good, once dead, return to their God and live in peace for eternity.
+ **Hell**: Where the spirits of the wicked, once dead, plummet to live in agony and woe with Hell’s ruler, Satan, and his demons.
+ **Purgatory (depending on who you ask)**: Where spirits of the dead go to await their placement in Heaven or Hell.

How about the Nine Realms of Norse Mythology?

+ **Niflheim**: The World of Fog and Mist, protected by the dragon, Nidhug.
+ **Muspelheim**: The Land of Fire, home of demons and fire giants, ruled by the giant Surtr, who hates the Aesir gods and will eventually bring their demise.
+ **Asgard**: Home of the Gods, where the Aesir rule the realms and mortals alike.
+ **Midgard**: Home of the Humans, located in the middle of the universe, occupied by the World Serpent that encircles the world, biting its own tail. 
+ **Jotunheim**: Home of the Giants, sworn enemy of the Aesir gods. It’s funny, because while they are sworn enemies... the Aesir and the giants often elope and bone and create half-giant half-Aesir babies, like Loki.
+ **Vanaheim**: Home of the Vanir, masters of sorcery and magic. The Aesir are gods of combat, while the Vanir are gods of magic. 
+ **Alfheim**: Home of the Light Elves. The Light Elves are often associated with beauty, knowledge, art, and music.
+ **Svartalfheim**: Home of the Dwarves, masters of craftsmanship. The dwarves are normally the makers of the powerful artifacts used by Gods and Humans.
+ **Helheim**: Home of the Dishonorable Dead, Thieves, Murders, and those not brave enough to go to Valhalla. It is ruled by Hel, and is a piss poor place to end up because it is cold and terrible. 
+ Connected by the world tree, **Yggdrasil**.

I know Dirk is very fond of the Plane of Dreams and always finds a way to interject his Plane into every. single. game that he runs. He does so very well and is very proud of it, so I can’t really fault him. 

Here are some questions I recommend asking yourself as you are creating the cosmos for your world, in addition to figuring out where the "places" are, as listed above:

+ What makes these planes different from our own?
+ Who lives on these planes? Who rules it?
+ How does this plane affect our own?
+ How do you travel from one plane to another?
