---

For the past few months, I have been running the Descent into Avernus campaign module. With the holidays and various scheduling conflicts, we had gone from being able to meet biweekly to meeting no-weekly. Luckily, January has been way better on us being able to get together, which has allowed us to finally (nearly) finish Chapter 1. 

Going forward, I would like to share my experiences running the game, as well as the experiences shared with me from the players so you can learn from my successes and failures. 

In the interest of avoiding spoilers, I will be more and more vague about the campaign itself and the details of it. The expectation here, is that you should buy the book and follow along. It's worth your time and your money.


## Campaign Homebrews
First of all, I'd like to cover what things were different about the rules for this game as opposed to vanilla 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons. 

1. **Wounds**: Every critical hit, and critical fail on a saving throw, resulted in an Open Wound. For each Open Wound a character has, it has one level of exhaustion. Characters may treat these Open Wounds as a Short Rest Activity with a successful DC 15 Heal (Wis) check. A Treated Wound does not give levels of exhaustion, but it does have a chance to reopen when a new wound is gained. At the end of a long rest, a character with a wound may attempt a saving throw to heal the wound, removing it entirely. *This is taken directly from GiffyGlyph's Darker Dungeons supplement.*
2. **Wear & Tear**: Rolling a natural 1 on an attack roll with a weapon causes the weapon damage dice to be reduced by one step (d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4 > 1 > BROKEN). Over the course of a short rest, a character can repair a damaged weapon by one step with a successful DC 15 Int (smith's tools) check. 
3. **Classes**: There are two classes being playtested in the campaign. A new _**Hollow Knight**_ class, whose design process is being lead by our own Otamhs, and a new _**Runic Mage**_ class, whose design process is being lead by myself, Dirk. *For more information regarding these classes, please join us on our Discord to ask us directly.*
4. **Subclasses**: One new subclass is being playtested. This is a Dark Souls themed Paladin subclass called _**"Oath of the Painting Guardian"**_. The character is also playtesting a new race, also Dark Souls themed because I'm a fanboi, _**Corvian**_.

More homebrew content will be tested throughout this campaign, most of which will be tested in Avernus itself.



### The Dark Secret
Descent into Avernus has a great system in place for integrating the players into the game. The Dark Secret. What this is, is a bond that brings each player character together for a purpose. The way it works, is the party chooses a single secret that they all share together, and then either roll or decide amongst themselves how it played out.  These secrets range from committing an act of murder to treason against Baldur's Gate. 

For my group, we decided to determine their secret and roles within their secret randomely. The result was that they were brought together by being involved in a heist by stealing the Spyglass of Balduran, basically a nifty trinket that was reportedly used by the founder of the city. Each of the characters had different roles from being a lockpicker, a lookout, a getaway guy, etc. 

A complicated factor for their heist though, was that when they went to fence the spyglass, they never got paid. Leaving him criminals hunted by the law, but also broke criminals on top of that. 

**Using the Dark Secret**: Admittedly, I did not implement the secret very well. My players had stolen the Spyglass, and it was known to one of the noble families (in this case it was Thalamra Vanthampur, a main antagonist) but from there... I didn't use it any further. 

##### Running it Again
My recommendation is for you to run a SESSSION 0 where the players play out the Dark Secret, Ocean's Eleven style. I did not do this due to our limited amount of time that we wanted to finish the entire campaign, but I highly recommend you do not make the same mistake I did.



### The Basilisk Gate
Descent into Avernus officially begins with the players already in Baldur's Gate amidst a massive refugee crisis. The neighboring city of Elturel has mysteriously vanished, leaving thousands of displaced citizens fleeing to Baldur's Gate. All adventurers within the city of Baldur's Gate are conscripted into service by the Flaming Fist and told to report to the Captain at the Basilisk Gate for their assignment. 

The player's assignment: Hunt down and eradicate a cult of devil worshippers within the walls of Baldur's Gate that the rest of the Fist cannot supply the manpower to get rid of. Failure to report or failure to comply results in execution at the hands of Flaming Fist mercenaries. Yikes.

My group accepted this shoehorn method of forcing the campaign forward without much complaint. For myself, I feel there is much more that can be done to make things much better.  

##### Running it Again
I highly recommend that if you are going to be running a Session 0, use the first part of Session 1 as a Hook, where you move the players directly from the resolution of their Dark Secret into this chapter. If the end result is to have the players collide with the devil cult, you could have them do so directly and make it feel more natural than: "Do these things on penalty of death by DM hand waving."


### Chasing the Cult
With the player's conscripted into the Flaming Fist, the Captain sends the players to meet a contact that will tell them where they can find said cultists. A fight ensues. Information exchanged. The next step is revealed. 

My players accepted this step, once again, with little complaint. This step of the campaign also provides the framework for almost every additioanl step that will be taken by the players until the resolution of the game. GO HERE AND BE TOLD WHERE TO GO NEXT. Not a terrible method of moving things along, but not necessarily interesting. 

The fight in this section is difficult for 4 players to get through. All but one of my players were reduced to 0 hp by the baddies, and it was a very close victory. Personally, if I were to run this fight again at 1st level, I would leave it the way it is so I could introduce the players to the difficulty and dangerous nature of the campaign. 

##### Running it Again
If I were to run the game again, after running the Dark Secret, I would either have the players meet directly with said contact that will share with them information about the cultists they ran into, or have the players find where the cult is hiding out on their own by identifying and following a dim-witted cultist. 



### The First Major Dungeon
The player characters follow the information of the contact to the first dungeon of the game. I'm not sure if you have read up on this dungeon on Reddit or on other platforms, but is a brutally crafted slaughterfest. 

It starts out fairly innocuous, with the searching for the entrance to the cultist hideout, but once the player characters make it, they are in for a world of pain. 

In the feautres for this dungeon / cultist hideout, there are specific rules for how to collapse rooms here. Each room is constructed with a semi-fragile wooden beam that can be damaged, causing a quasi-cave-in. The resulting damage is significant for low-level characters, to the point that it is likely a character caught in the collapse will be reduced to 0 or outright be killed. 

The dungeon features two areas that seem to be specifically built to utilize this feature. One is a chamber full of natural gas, that explodes when fire is brough tinto it. The damage from which will very likely kill a character. The other is a fight with a ridiculous NPC in a morgue scenario that wields not one... but TWO Fireball spells. Keep in mind, that the players are level 2. Level 2 facing down a dual fireball wielding caster in a room that can collapse upon them. 

For the natural gas room, I recommend doing something similar to what I did, which was notify the players ahead of time that the sewer smells like flammable gas, and even though it's dark, it may be dangeorus to use torches (knowledge which I gave to anyone proficient with Survival or Nature). When the players reached this room, I allowed for a Perception, Survival, or Nature check to detect the gas buildup and douse the flames of their torches before the gas is ignited. Luckily, the character making said check had darkvision and was scouting ahead of the party. 

For the insane fireball-wielder... Suggestions from other DM's in other places say to not cast the fireballs. I did. I would do it again. I have never seen panic on the faces of D&D players in the way that I saw their panic. Before this, however, I recommend making sure each player has an inspiration point, or some way to gain advantage on the saving throw, so that the entire party isn't potential taken out by bad rolls. The hard part, however, is that with the location this NPC is encountered, it is very heavily implied that the last fireball is meant for a "final bang" moment, where he nukes himself, collapses the room, and kills everyone inside. This would be a dick move. Don't do that.

At the end of the dungeon is the trigger to the next part. Really, it kind of leaves the players with a fork in the road, with both forks leading to the same place. The main idea here, is that the son of a very influential political family reveals that his family has been running and funding the cult for some time. He gives up the location of his brother, and gives up the dirt on his mother. 

One thing that happens that does make things a litle weird, is how the players are encountered by a small group of Tiamat cultists on their way out. What makes it weird, is that there is very little reference that this group of dragon cultists exist, and for the rest of the player's time in Baldur's Gate, they do not encounter the cultists ever again. Weird. 

##### Running it Again
Honestly, I'm fine with the difficulty of this dungeon. I would definitely be sure to be careful with the collapsing rooms, explodey gas, and the fireball slinging. Give the players a bit of a heads up so they have a chance to roleplay their way out of it. At least hint at the danger to those that are proficient with releveant skills, and if the palyers fall into a deadly trap, do your best to minimize the casualties by only affecting a couple of the group instead of the whole gang. 

Additionally, integrating the Cult of Tiamat into the campaign wouldn’t be a bad idea. I’ll get to this later. 



### The Villa
My players decided to hunt down the brother first. They beat him up, killed his fiendish companion, and got more dirt on the family. They did not, however, kill the fellow. 

After shaking the brother down, they launched a night assault on the family’s villa. The villa has a tall wall surrounding it as well as guards on the outside grounds and the upper level, as well as invisible imps. The party really liked how well this was set up, without me having to get creative or write new things for it. 

The players scaled the walls and creeped in through an unlocked window on the ground floor. Here, they were ambushed by invisible imps. Throughout the rest of the main floor, the players continued to be assaulted by invisible imps. Luckily, these little guys didn’t put up much of a challenge or threat.

Upstairs, however, was a different story. After climbing the stairs, they come across a few guards. They accidentally alerted these guards, which alerted the outside guards. The resulting bloodbath was fairly significant with the party corralling the guards to fight in a narrow corridor. The sheer numbers of the guards themselves caused the fight to be difficult. 

When the bloodbath was over, the players were able to explore the rest of the villa. They found a Helmed Horror (big yikes), whose fight they found extremely boring, and they found another brother. This brother was found with a major plot piece, which the party gladly killed him for. 

Inside the villa was really easy to run. The difficulty of the fights was mild compared to what the party had accomplished so far, which is really good considering the potential ass-kicking the comes next. 

There was also plenty of things for the party to loot here. They stole pretty much anything that wasn’t nailed down. One of the players has a background as a fence, being able to sell stolen goods, so that made things a little easier on them to explain how they plan to sell the silverware  and candlesticks of one of the most influential noble families in the city. 

##### Running it Again
With as much as I liked the simplicity of how this area is run, there are some changes I would make if I ran it again. 

I would get much more mileage out of the imps. Setting up cruel little devilish traps for intruders would certainly be fun and make things a little more interesting. 

The Helmed Horror poses an interesting situation that I’m not sure I want to keep. The Horror is a beat stick with an immense AC and plenty of immunities, but it is boring. So boring. I think I would have the player characters encounter the imps in the lower level, that would retreat to the room with the Helmed Horror. Here, they would get the Horror prepared to fight, and set one or two of the bookcases to fall over on intruders. Once the room is set, a couple of the imps stay behind, while the rest lure the party into the room. 

The last thing I would have done differently, is described the villa to be more like a devil worshipper’s home. Creepy. Evil images. Evil portraits. Evil feeling. Creeping floorboards. Evil. Creepy. Evil. Creepy. In that order.


### Eradicating the Cult
Beneath the villa lies the final dungeon of the first chapter. It begins with the player characters taking the stairs into the cellar and being ambushed by some real devils. They may be spined devils, and they may not put up much of a fight, but it is refreshing to put the party up against some devils in a devil-themed campaign.

Beyond a door in the cellar lies the sewers, which has been converted for use by the devil cult. These cultists are a little different, and do not have the cool abilities of the cultists in the first dungeon, but it is nice to fight some cultists anyway. 

The party found some cultists on patrol with incense burners, which were swiftly killed, disrobed, and used as disguises. The first real room that was discovered was probably the best one for them to find: The Shrine. Here, a bunch of cultists are on their knees before a statue of a certain Archduke of Hell, overseen by a Barbed Devil. 

After some uncertainty, the party decides to attack the cultists. The cultists are cheap and flimsy, but Barbed Devil can put up a good fight against low-level characters, especially when he is dangerous with ranged attacks and melee attacks. 

Once the party dispatched the cultists and the devil, they explored the Shrine. Here, the players decided to insult the Archduke, and I made a big mistake. In the interest of making things more interesting, I described the consequence for their rudeness as follows:  *"You look into the glowing white eyes of the Archduke and spew your insults. A shudder of stinking sewer air ripples through the room and snuffs out all of the candles and lit lanterns in the corridors surrounding the Shrine. You feel like your insults were heard."*

The party attempted to light a torch, which was immediately snuffed out. The only light in the room coming from the glowing eyes of the statue of the Archduke. The party did not bring any magical sources of light with them, through abilities, spells, or otherwise, so most of them were stuck in darkness. Instead of choosing to go back upstairs and either wait out the darkness or look for a magical source of light to dispel the darkness, they barricaded themselves into a neighboring room (the kitchen and dining area) and attempted a short rest. Enter part two of my big mistake. 

The rest of the dungeon is not uninhabited. Some cultists come looking for the missing patrols and discover a room full of their slain brethren. The cultists alert their cult-bros, and get the assistance of something bigger... the Duke herself, who was also in the cellar performing her own worship to her Archduke patron. 

The party is quickly discovered, and their barricaded room invaded. I underestimated the power of the Duke and her Eldritch Blasts, and used the cardboard cultists as body blockers. The Duke opens fire through a hole in the door and reduces a party member to 0 hit points. The cultists have the *light* spell written into their statblock, which and so they have it cast upon themselves, and push through the barricade and get slaughtered by the party, but not before another gets taken out by the Duke’s blasts. After a few rounds of combat it comes down to a one-on-one showdown between the last party member and the Duke. 

The Duke, still having substantial hit points, and the player having very few, decided not to destroy the party or capture them and put them in holding cells. She instead questioned the survivor, found that they were sent by the Captain of the Flaming Fist, and struck a bargain. She would let them leave the dungeon if they went to kill the Captain and destroy any evidence of cultist connection to herself and her family. The survivor agreed. The Duke planned to kill them anyways. 


##### Running it Again
If I could rewind time, I would have let the party reignite their torches, or I would have previously given them an item that is able to produce magical light. There was an item already built into the dungeon that provided this ability, a magical weapon that was staring the players in the face, but they did not push forward to find it. I would have definitely used better descriptions to help lead the players to finding the item for themselves. 

Additionally, the fight with the combined strength of the Duke and the cultists was overwhelming for the party due to their injuries and expended resources, but also because we only had 3 players present. With one more player, the players would have won without a TPK. It would have been close, but they could have won. If this situation arises for you, the change you could make is simply lower the hit points of the Duke and reduce the number of cultists by 1 Fanatic and 2-4 regular cultists. 

The bargain with the Duke was interesting and the party really liked it. I should have had the Duke either keep one of the wounded players as collateral for compliance, and I totally forgot to have her cultists shake down the players for the quest item they received and all the dishes and silverware they stole. Oops.


### Killing The Captain
The party made it back to an inn and finished a long rest. They spent part of the next day fencing the goods they had stolen and bought some armor and adventuring gear. One of the party members with high Arcana and Perception noticed they were being followed by ravens. With his knowledge of devils, he quickly deduced that they were being followed by shape changing imps, likely as spies for the Duke. 

The party originally planned to skip town but decided against it at the revelation that they were being followed. Instead of trying to evade the raven-imps, they made their way to the Captain with a murderous intent. 

When the Captain is first introduced, he is given an entourage of soldiers using the **veteran** statblock. Each one of these veterans has a name. I drew the layout for the office building the Captain had appropriated, and introduced each of the soldiers by name. 

The party decided against killing the Captain and his entourage, and instead decided, unsurprisingly, to betray the Duke by telling the Captain everything. In the middle of their explanation, devil cultists break through the windows and kick down the front door. A lot of them. I used the special Descent into Avernus cultists with the cool abilities. One of the cool abilities some of these low CR cultists have is essentially the ability to give vulnerability to piercing damage dealt by them. Basically they are CR 1/2 double damage machines. Glass cannons to the end. 

The party scrambles to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with the veterans to protect the Captain as the cult comes to tie up the last of the loose ends. In all honesty, the cultists were coming to kill the party anyways. 

When the fight is closing out, after losing a couple of the veterans to cultist blades and magic, the players hear the entire back wall of the building collapse, accompanied by a piercing fiendish scream. A bone devil, summoned by the Duke to ensure victory, has come to murder the party. The party officially panics when they watch the bone devil annihilate the tough veterans and they decide it is time to flee and get the Captain to safety. 

For the first time ever, I used the chase mechanics listed in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. The bone devil is not only faster than the entire party, but it also has flight. Luckily, the party quickly identified a sewer entry and hid inside with the Captain, leaving the bone devil upon the streets murdering innocent civilians. 

The party, remembering the Duke’s villa is located in the sewers, decides to try to navigate back to it only using the sewer tunnels. They did so successfully and were able to return to the villa for revenge. 

##### Running it Again
Personally, I loved running this and my party has been blowing up our discord about it ever since. Many of my players are veterans that know the CR of the bone devil and know they certainly would never survive a real encounter with it. 

If I were to run this again, I would have definitely played up the massacre the bone devil was able to perform upon the innocents caught in the streets. Giving the players more emotional and moral interest to at least try and organize some kind of effort to quickly stop the bone devil would have gone a long way to push the characters into a hero role, as well as hammer home the dangerous nature of the power of hell. 


### Revenge
The party returned to the villa through the sewers. The homebrew Runic Mage used his Seidr Magic feature to turn an iron gate blocking the way into dust, providing them quiet entry. The party, now in full sneaky-murder mode, sneak into the first room they find: the holding cells, guarded by a bearded devil. The devil is brought down quickly, and the prisoners freed. 

One of the prisoners was an extremely important NPC who, as written in the book, has the layout of the dungeon memorized, and gives the players direction on how to reach the secret rooms. The NPC also tells the players to take the quest item they found to Candlekeep to have it investigated by a wizard that is studying the devil problems in Elturel and Baldur’s Gate. The party follows his directions and finds the Duke in her secret shrine. They quickly murder her without much fight. 

The party’s next stop is the Duke’s vault, obviously to rob it. Here, they meet one of the most important NPCs in the chapter, and find a certain shield. The NPC has a shadow of a short, pudgy demon, which immediately causes the players to ask a few questions, and then quickly murder him. The shield, however, reaches out telepathically, telling them that it is a powerful celestial being trapped by the devil cultists, who plan to use it’s powers for evil. The players take the shield. 

The last room the player’s investigate is the ritual chamber. The description is creepy and complete with a devilish circle carved in the stone floor and a ceiling decorated with pit fiend sculptures. 

The rest of the dungeon is deserted, because the party had already killed all of the cultists here, and any others the Duke had are elsewhere. 

When the players return to the surface, they are met by the Captain they saved and a small army of Flaming Fist. Their intent: burn the villa and kill the Duke. With the Duke slain, the Fist burns down the villa.

##### Running it Again
The revenge felt great for the players. They’ve told me so many times, as well as I could feel their excitement to get back at the Duke. However, there are some things that I’d finally change about the final dungeon. 

1. The ritual chamber should be glowing with fiendish power and be littered with dead cultists and sacrificed innocents. In the center of the chamber should be a fire manifestation of the Archduke being worshipped. When the party enters the room, the fire should immediately dissipate, but the ritual circle still remain glowing. Any creature stepping onto the circle should be transported immediately to Avernus, starting the next chapter. 
2. I didn’t use the barbed devil very well. I should have had him jump on a weak character and give them a big, barbed bear hug. The fight didn’t feel dangerous for the players, partially also due to bad rolls on my end. 
3. The shield that the players discover should push them to go to the ritual chamber discussed in point 1, and it should urge the one wielding or carrying the shield to step into the circle. 
The main reasoning behind my changes to the ritual room are simple. The way the campaign pushes the characters to go to hell is really weak and not that interesting. It would be much more interesting for one of the party members to disappear into hell, and the rest of the party being incentivized to head there so they could rescue their comrade. 


### Closing the Chapter
My party has not officially ended the chapter. They ended with leaving Baldur’s Gate, one of the player having commissioned a beautiful painting of himself which is now held in a barracks named after him for his bravery, and entering the view of Candlekeep to investigate the quest item, a puzzle box made of infernal iron (definitely not from Hellraiser). 

I will stop here with my review, because I know my players are reading this. 

## Unused Hooks
Here are some hooks that I would like to use if I were to run this campaign again:
1. The Guild is having issues with their extortion racket they are running due to many of their "customers" being attacked and intimidated by a new set of baddies on the block. Devil cultists. The party is tasked with shaking down some of the Guild’s clients for information and subsequently put an end to the threat to their crime monopoly. 
2. The party is coming home from an evening of drinking and adventurer stuff when they stumble upon devil cultists beating / kidnapping / murdering some Elturel refugees. The players stop the assault and either question the cultists or find a trinket on them that leads them to the cultist hideout.
3. One of the party member’s main contacts, friends, or family members has been kidnapped. The authorities aren’t doing anything about it because people go missing in Baldur’s Gate all the time. The only clue you have is a tattered piece of black cloth with a single rune, written in infernal, that says, "War."
4. The Hhune patriar family contacts you through a mutual friend because of your discretion and "specific moral qualities." A family heirloom, a magical shield, has been stolen from them. Find their hideout and return the shield. 
5. Rumors have it that the cult of the dragon has lost a large amount of their offerings to their goddess, Tiamat. Chests full of gold and gems were stolen and are now hidden by the thieves. Who knows what terrible things people can do with that kind of money. Maybe someone more trustworthy should retrieve it and put the money to good use.
6.  A high ranking wizard from Candlekeep is looking for "able bodied adventurers with no family or relatives that want a way to earn fast gold... if they survive." Other adventurers in the city know what this means. It means being sent into a nest of demon or devil worshippers with bad information, getting captured, and being sacrificed to whatever dark god they worship.

## Final Statements
All in all, Chapter 1 is very great. I would definitely do things differently as a DM if I were to run this again. The last main suggestion I have is to make Baldur’s Gate a great experience for your players by integrating them directly into the setting. Additionally, hammer home the danger of the campaign. Threaten the lives of the players and scare the hell out of them.
